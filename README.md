## Some details about the project
The project is in the project_notebook.ipynb notebook. It contains a short review of the topic, the code with the analysis explained and the discussion of the results.

I used data coming from the 1000 Genomes Project to compute the linkage disequilibrium coefficients, so that I could compare results obtained from synthetic haplotypes with real data.
Since data from the 1000 Genomes Project are not in a .csv format, I used the software PLINK to calculate LD coefficients. I preferred to leave details about the download of data and computation
of LD coefficients from 1000 Genomes Project in a separate notebook (Supplementary_material.ipynb). Since the full execution of this notebook could take a while, the .csv files that are the final result of 
this notebook have been already created and are ready for the analysis in the main notebook.
